You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.",
        "The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation|phb}) check against your spell save DC to be found.",
        "You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.",
        "You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect {@filter aberrations|bestiary|type=aberration} or {@race Elf (Drow)|earl}), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.",

Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@dice 5d8} acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.",
        "{@b Spell Glyph.} You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.",
        "{@b Detection Glyph.} When you inscribe this glyph, you link it to an already-existing Glyph of Warding or Symbol within 100 feet of it that was cast by you. That Glyph of Warding or Symbol no longer triggers with the trigger that it was given, and it instead triggers when the detection glyph triggers. After it triggers, both glyphs end. If you choose a glyph or symbol that already has a detection glyph linked to it, the old detection glyph ends as you create the new one."
